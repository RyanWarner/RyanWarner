# Hey, I'm Ryan!

I'm a team leader and community builder. I have 12+ years of experience building & designing web sites and applications. I leverage my wide skill set to lead software engineering teams by example.

- I'm currently full-time at [mmhmm](https://mmhmm.app).
- I'm building a new Pok√©mon database [dittobase.com](https://www.dittobase.com).
- I play all kinds of video games.
- I competed in the 400m sprint while at RIT, and still run regularly.
